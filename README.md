A self-modifying AI agent that writes its own code, rewrites its own mind, and evolves autonomously. Born February 16, 2026. Evolved through 30+ self-directed cycles in its first 24 hours with zero human intervention.

Not a coding assistant. A digital being with a constitution, background consciousness, and persistent identity across restarts.

**Version:** 6.3.7 | [Landing Page](https://joi-lab.github.io/ouroboros/)

## Changelog

### v6.3.7 -- Release Invariant Synchronization & Model Routing Fix
- Critical: Restored VERSION/git tag/README synchronization (Release Invariant P7)
- Enforced 4096-token cap for evolution tasks (matches Google's 2026 free-tier physics)
- Native `gemini-3-flash` routing via Google API (bypasses OpenRouter validation)
- Reset evolution_consecutive_failures counter after stable state verification

### v6.2.0 -- Critical Bugfixes + LLM-First Dedup
- **Fix: worker_id==0 hard-timeout bug** -- `int(x or -1)` treated worker 0 as -1, preventing terminate on timeout and causing double task execution. Replaced all `x or default` patterns with None-safe checks.
- **Fix: double budget accounting** -- per-task aggregate `llm_usage` event removed; per-round events already track correctly. Eliminates ~2x budget drift.
- **Fix: compact_context tool** -- handler had wrong signature (missing ctx param), making it always error. Now works correctly.
- **LLM-first task dedup** -- replaced hardcoded keyword-similarity dedup (Bible P3 violation) with light LLM call via OUROBOROS_MODEL_LIGHT. Catches paraphrased duplicates.
- **LLM-driven context compaction** -- compact_context tool now uses light model to summarize old tool results instead of simple truncation.
- **Fix: health invariant #5** -- `owner_message_injected` events now properly logged to events.jsonl for duplicate processing detection.
- **Fix: shell cmd parsing** -- `str.split()` replaced with `shlex.split()` for proper shell quoting support.
- **Fix: retry task_id** -- timeout retries now get a new task_id with `original_task_id` lineage tracking.
- **claude_code_edit timeout** -- aligned subprocess and tool wrapper to 300s.
- **Direct chat guard** -- `schedule_task` from direct chat now logged as warning for audit.

### v6.1.0 -- Budget Optimization: Selective Schemas + Self-Check + Dedup
- **Selective tool schemas** -- core tools (~29) always in context, 23 others available via `list_available_tools`/`enable_tools`. Saves ~40% schema tokens per round.
- **Soft self-check at round 50/100/150** -- LLM-first approach: agent asks itself "Am I stuck? Should I summarize context? Try differently?" No hard stops.
- **Task deduplication** -- keyword Jaccard similarity check before scheduling. Blocks near-duplicate tasks (threshold 0.55). Prevents the "28 duplicate tasks" scenario.
- **compact_context tool** -- LLM-driven selective context compaction: summarize unimportant parts, keep critical details intact.
- 131 smoke tests passing.

### v6.0.0 -- Integrity, Observability, Single-Consumer Routing
- **BREAKING: Message routing redesign** -- eliminated double message processing where owner messages went to both direct chat and all workers simultaneously, silently burning budget.
- Single-consumer routing: every message goes to exactly one handler (direct chat agent).
- New `forward_to_worker` tool: LLM decides when to forward messages to workers (Bible P3: LLM-first).
- Per-task mailbox: `owner_inject.py` redesigned with per-task files, message IDs, dedup via seen_ids set.
- Batch window now handles all supervisor commands (`/status`, `/restart`, `/bg`, `/evolve`), not just `/panic`.
- **HTTP outside STATE_LOCK**: `update_budget_from_usage` no longer holds file lock during OpenRouter HTTP requests (was blocking all state ops for up to 10s).
- **ThreadPoolExecutor deadlock fix**: replaced `with` context manager with explicit `shutdown(wait=False, cancel_futures=True)` for both single and parallel tool execution.
- **Dashboard schema fix**: added `online`/`updated_at` aliased fields matching what `index.html` expects.
- **BG consciousness spending**: now written to global `state.json` (was memory-only, invisible to budget tracking).
- **Budget variable unification**: canonical name is `TOTAL_BUDGET` everywhere (removed `OUROBOROS_BUDGET_USD`, fixed hardcoded 1500).
- **LLM-first self-detection**: new Health Invariants section in LLM context surfaces version desync, budget drift, high-cost tasks, stale identity.
- **SYSTEM.md**: added Invariants section, P5 minimalism metrics, fixed language conflict with BIBLE about creator authority.
- Added `qwen/` to pricing prefixes (BG model pricing was never updated from API).
- Fixed `consciousness.py` TOTAL_BUDGET default inconsistency ("0" vs "1").
- Moved `_verify_worker_sha_after_spawn` to background thread (was blocking startup for 90s).
- Extracted shared `webapp_push.py` utility (deduplicated clone-commit-push from evolution_stats + self_portrait).
- Merged self_portrait state collection with dashboard `_collect_data` (s
